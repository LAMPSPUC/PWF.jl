| --------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Bus                         | Bus number as defined in DBAR                                                                                |
| Operation                   | Static reactive compensator data addition, removal or modification                                           |
| Gruop                       | Static reactive compensator group identification number; One or more groups can be connected to the same bus |
| Unities                     | Number of unities which constitute the group                                                                 |
| Controlled bus              | Bus number, as defined in DBAR, which voltage will be controlled                                             |
| Inclination                 | Slope of the linear piece of the static reactive compensator model curve (%)                                 |
| Reactive generation         | Current reactive power generation                                                                            |
| Minimum reactive generation | Lower reactive generation bound that defines the linear piece of the static reactive compensator model curve |
| Maximum reactive generation | Upper reactive generation bound that defines the linear piece of the static reactive compensator model curve |
| Control mode                | P for power control generated by the compensator; I for current control injected by the compensator          |
| Status                      | L if the compensator group is on, D if it is off                                                             |
